Ivan just had his second sniffles. It lasted about five days total and was very mild. He was able to breathe through the nose most of the time and did not seem bothered by it. I think it was thanks to the following factors:

1. We caught the onset early on and started treating immediately.

2. We kept giving him homeopathic remedy for cold for babies: [Boiron's Coryzalia](http://boiron.ca/products/children/coryzalia-children/) 

3. We used a good nasal aspirator whenever it seemed like his nose it too stuffed for him to relax. Definitely add [Hydrasense](http://www.hydrasense.ca/en/products/details/2) to your gift registry, or shopping list, it will come in handy, and it's amazingly effective and easy to use.

4. We tried maintaining fresh moist air in the house.

5. We made sure he rests well and gets good sleep.
