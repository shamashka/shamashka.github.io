* ######Share mealtime
  *let your baby participate in the family dinners - bring the rocker to the table, or whatever your baby lounges in. Once your baby is able to sit for some time with supported back, get the high hair and her sit in the high hair during the meals. She may play with some of her toys, watch you eat and get to know the smells and looks of your food. Be an example toy your child.

* ######Let them sample
  * let your baby smell different foods and tell her about those foods (e.g. Orange, chilantro, banana). choose foods with pronounced and pleasant smell. Then, show her how you eat them.

  * once first signs of teething set in - some raw vegetables can be very pleasant to chew on, such as carrots or cucumbers. Your baby won't be eating them, as they are too hard, but peeled carrots, cool from the fridge may be just the right thing for those gums - much better than chewing on some plastic. Always keep an eye on your little chewer, to make sure no pieces of food chip off, creating potential choking hazard. Cucumbers are soft enough to be chewed to pieces. My baby managed to eat some of the soft seedy center of the cucumber, but I saw no problem in that. Just when you see the slice of cucumber getting soft and mushy, replace it with a new one, so that your little one does not swallow the cucumber skin. A 3/4 inch slice of English cucumber works well.

  * once you start introducing solids, if your little has been showing much interest in what you are eating, you may let him share fruit snacks with you. If you are eating a ripe pear, why not let him smell it, and if he wants to, let him rub his gums against the fleshy part of the pear - he'll get a taste of it and will get to know its actual texture. Same can be done with an apple, or a banana. 

* ######Follow their lead
  * watch for signs of whether your baby likes and wants a particular food. If he refuses it, let it be for the time being. Give it another try in a couple of days, then again in a couple days more. He may need some time to get used to a particular taste. Ivan kept reaching for my pear, so I let him try it - he began to rub his gums on it with great appetite, and later, when I was introducing fruits, pear purée was one of the first ones I offered, and he gladly ate it. When I offered Ivan a slice of apple to chew on, during the sampling phase, he made a sour face and did not show much enthusiasm. I did not press it on him. In a couple of days I offered him some apple again, and he chewed it a little, but lost interest fast. A few weeks later his dad offered him apple purée, and Ivan welcomed the offering. 

* ######Lead by example
  * I believe they way you feel abut the food you are offering to your baby reflects on how she will eat it. I'm sure they watch us closely for signs on whether the food is safe and tasty to eat, so when you offer the fist spoons to your little one, try to feel really good about that food
