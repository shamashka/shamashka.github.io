The best app to use once the baby is here is BabyConnect.
During the first days and weeks after birth you may want to monitor and document the feedings, pees, poos, sleep and measurements. Later on you may want to keep track of meals, mark the developmental milestones, date the vaccines, etc.

BabyConnect helps you easily time various activities such as feeding or sleep, gives you nice statistical analysis and overview and, what's really cool, it syncs the data between devices through a cloud site, so that several caregivers can input or review the data. Ivan is over six months now and we are still using this app. It has been saving me many times when I need to remember which breast to offer or when I need to check how much time has passed since the last feeding. This may sound ridiculous, but when you are many days away from decent sleep, dealing with adjustment to being a parent, sense of time gets pretty distorted. Timing the feedings is also very helpful, as you can monitor how much your baby nursed in a day, compare it to other days and teach tendencies and patterns.
