The initial days of breastfeeding may be pretty challenging and painful. 

Most of the issues and difficulties that arose in these first days are totally resolvable.

There are plenty of resources that will teach the holding techniques and how to ensure proper latching. Use all the resources you need and stay positive and persistent. You have a good year, or even more or maybe six months of breastfeeding ahead of you and it will definitely become much easier and will feel like second nature in no time. Usually the first week is the time of learning and adjustment, and after the milk comes in and feeding is established you'll be glad you're doing it.

Here are a few things that may make the initial days much better:

- Lansinoh lanolin ointment - nothing soothes sore nipples better! It is safe to keep it on when feeding the baby, it stays on well and contains no additives.

- MyBreastFriend nursing pillow - perfect for breastfeeding newborns. It offers well needed back support and holds the baby right at a perfect level for latching on your breast. 

- Cabbage leaves - when engorgement begins, nothing soothes those hot watermelons better! Just get a couple of nice whole leaves off the cabbage head and put them on like breast cups - the effect is immediate. You can keep them on for a couple of hours and change them when they get saggy.
