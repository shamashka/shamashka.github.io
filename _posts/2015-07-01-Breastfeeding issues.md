- - if you are wondering about whether everything is going well with the breastfeeding, or you have an immediate concern in the middle of the night and breastfeeding consultants are not available through 24/7 hotline, go to [La Leche League website] (http:/www.llli.org). There you can search by keyword for a particular issue you are having and you will get great answers and explanations and suggestions on what to do. Many times I had my worries eased thanks to LLL.
If you are more into flipping the physical pages, get "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding" - you can find it in the library. That's a book the size of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it has every possible detail on breastfeeding and related issues. When I first saw it, I though no way so much can be written on such simple topic as breastfeeding! How complex can it be? Put baby on breast - let baby suck. Different positions and issues, I thought, would fit into a brochure... Boy, was I wrong! 

This is the issue I am currently dealing with: Breastmilk oversupply and overactive letdown. 
What is it? My body got so enthusiastic about the arrival of a second baby that it is producing milk enough to feed several babies! And overactive letdown is my now super-loaded breasts shooting the milk out so zealously that my poor lil one chokes! Some compare this experience to drinking out of an open hose while laying down. This problem has symptoms that may be confused with food sensitivity: 

* baby's poop is green, sometimes frothy, sometimes mucousy
* baby may be gassy and bloated (restless and fussy as the result)
* feedings last very short time, somewhere between 2 and 10 minutes.


Overactive letdown, in addition to the above, presents as following:

* you feel some pain during the letdown
* you see milk spraying or continuously dripping out during the letdown and initial minutes of feeding
* baby may get on the breast and then get off just after a gulp or two, possibly crying. The more persistent ones keep going back on and off the breast.
* baby may choke and cough while making gulps, coming off the breast

Here is the solution that helped me resolve the issue:

It's called Block Feeding.  You simply continue offering one breast several feedings in a row until it's emptied. Usually it takes about three feedings to do this. Avoid using the pump to express the extra milk as this will only encourage your body to produce  more milk...
